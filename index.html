<!--iron man is my favorite avengers-->
<p class="para3">Iron Man is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby. The character made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39 (cover dated March 1963), and received his own title in Iron Man #1 (May 1968). Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark is a character portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film franchise, based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name and known commonly by his alter ego, Iron Man. In the films, Tony Stark is an industrialist, genius inventor, and consummate playboy who is CEO of Stark Industries. At the beginning of the series, he is a chief weapons manufacturer for the U.S. military, until he has a change of heart and redirects his technical knowledge into the creation of powered exoskeleton suits of armor which he uses to defend against those that would threaten peace around the world.

As of 2019, the character is one of the central figures of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, having appeared in nine films of the series (including a brief cameo in The Incredible Hulk). In 2015, the evolution of the character over the series was described as "the defining arc of the Marvel Cinematic Universe",[1] and in 2018 it was argued that "no other character goes on as transformative a journey as Iron Man".[2]
